# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System-main
The Face Recognition Attendance System is an AI-based application designed to automate attendance processes using facial recognition technology. It captures the faces of individuals, processes them for feature extraction, and recognizes them during attendance marking sessions. The system enhances efficiency and accuracy in attendance recording, eliminating the need for manual input.

# Features
Real-Time Face Detection: Uses OpenCV to detect faces in real time.
Face Recognition: Employs machine learning techniques to recognize faces and mark attendance.
Automated Attendance Marking: Automatically records attendance for recognized individuals.
Multi-user Support: Capable of handling multiple individuals at once.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for administrators to manage attendance data.
Dataset Generation: Ability to add new faces to the system for future recognition.

# Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV for face detection and recognition
NumPy for matrix operations
SQLite/MySQL for attendance data storage

# Usage
Launch the application.
Add new users by capturing their facial data through the webcam.
Train the system to recognize the new faces.
Start the real-time detection system to automatically mark attendance.

# Future Enhancements
Improve facial recognition accuracy using deep learning models.
Add a web-based interface for managing attendance data.
Implement email notifications for absent individuals.
